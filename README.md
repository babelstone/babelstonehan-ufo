# babelstonehan-ufo

Unified Font Object (UFO) files for the latest pre-release versions of [BabelStone Han Basic and Extra](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Han.html) and [BabelStone Han PUA](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/PUA.html). Formal releases of BabelStone Han are made several times a year, but the UFO files and ttf fonts in this repository are updated frequently, usually whenever new characters are added to the Extra and PUA fonts (the Basic font is more stable, and only occasional updates for glyph improvements and IVS additions are expected).
